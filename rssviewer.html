			<p>The factors that lead to tragedies like the Lewiston shooting are deeply ingrained in US politics, culture, and law.</p>
			<p id="aZtQSt">At least 
				<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/lewiston-maine-mass-shooting/?id=104322983">20 people have been killed</a> and several dozen injured in a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine — the northern state’s second-largest city. 
			</p>
			<p id="RCXiaD">The shooter wasn’t immediately apprehended and appears to have opened fire at several locations, including a bowling alley and bar on Wednesday evening. State and local law enforcement have asked residents to 
				<a href="https://x.com/MEStatePolice/status/1717332516569243796?s=20">shelter in place</a> as officials work to detain the shooter.
			</p>
			<p id="7ovQAV">It’s one of several hundred mass shootings this year, and follows a number of other mass shootings this week, including in 
				<a href="https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/one-killed-three-injured-in-shooting-at-santa-rita-park-in-durango/">Colorado</a>, 
				<a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-shooting-englewood-today-justine-street/13961764/">Chicago</a>, and 
				<a href="https://www.cenlanow.com/crime/alexandria-pd-search-for-kelly-street-shooting-suspect-ldarius-taylor/">Louisiana</a>. This kind of violence is unique to the US and should not be normalized.
			</p>
			<p id="kV8Il1">No other high-income country has suffered such a high death toll from
				<a href="https://www.vox.com/22382180/supreme-court-uvalde-guns-violence-second-amendment-heller-scalia"> gun violence</a>. Every day, 
				<a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/">120</a> Americans die at the end of a gun, including suicides and homicides, an average of 43,375 per year. According to the latest available analysis of data from 2015 to 2019,
				<strong></strong>the US gun homicide rate was 
				<a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/">26 times</a> that of other high-income countries; its gun suicide rate was nearly 
				<a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/">12 times higher</a>. Mass shootings, defined as attacks in which at least four people are injured or killed excluding the shooter, have been on the rise since 2015, peaking at 
				<a href="https://everytownresearch.org/mass-shootings-in-america/">686 incidents in 2021</a>. There have been
				<strong></strong>
				<a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting">564 mass shootings</a> in the US in 2023 as of late October, and at the current pace, the US is set to 
				<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/24/politics/us-400-mass-shootings/index.html">eclipse the 2021 record</a> this year.
			</p>
			<p id="rE1fGR">Despite that sheer carnage, however, the political debate over how to ensure that guns don’t fall into the hands of people who may hurt themselves and others has long proved intractable. Last year,
				<strong></strong>Congress reached a 
				<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass">deal on limited gun reforms</a> for the first time in nearly 30 years
				<strong></strong>in the wake of a shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas — the deadliest school shooting since 2012. 
			</p>
			<p id="3IgO6E">But those narrow reforms clearly haven’t stopped America’s gun violence epidemic. The US’s expansive view of civilian gun ownership has been so ingrained in politics, in culture, and in the law since the nation’s founding that there’s no telling how many more people will die before federal lawmakers take further action. In that absence, many red states have loosened their gun laws over the last few years, rather than making it harder to obtain a gun. </p>
			<p id="UQmeyK">“America is unique in that guns have always been present, there is wide civilian ownership, and the government hasn’t claimed more of a monopoly on them,” said David Yamane, a professor at Wake Forest University who studies American gun culture. </p>
			<h3 id="r8kFVU">The US has a lot of guns, and more guns mean more gun deaths </h3>
			<p id="2Ga6He">It’s hard to estimate the number of privately owned guns in America since there is no countrywide database where people register whether they own guns, there is a
				<a href="https://www.everytown.org/issues/gun-trafficking/"> thriving black market</a> for them in the absence of strong federal gun trafficking laws, and people can manufacture their own guns with DIY kits or 3D printers. The gun lobby has also 
				<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/atf-gun-laws-nra/">vehemently opposed</a> federal legislation to track gun sales and establish a national handgun registry. 
			</p>
			<p id="IZkQHX">One estimate from the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research project, found that there were approximately
				<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081"> 390 million guns</a> in circulation in the US in 2018, or about 120.5 firearms per 100 residents. That number has likely climbed in the years since, given that
				<a href="https://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/one-in-five-american-households-purchased-a-gun-during-the-pandemic.aspx"> one in five households</a> purchased a gun during the pandemic, though the 2018 estimate remains the most recent available. There has also been a significant increase in the number of 
				<a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/">guns manufactured and imported</a> in the years since. But even without accounting for that increase, US gun ownership is still well above any other country: Yemen, which has the world’s second-highest level of gun ownership, has only 52.8 guns per 100 residents; in Iceland, it’s 31.7.

				</figure>
				<p id="IbOmoq">American guns are concentrated in a tiny minority of households: just 3 percent own about half the nation’s guns, according to a 2016 Harvard and Northeastern University
					<a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2016/09/study-70m-more-firearms-added-to-us-gun-stock-over-past-20-years/"> study</a>. They’re called “
					<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/us-gun-ownership-survey">super owners</a>” who have an average of 17 guns each. Gallup, using a different methodology, found that
					<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx">
						<strong></strong>45 percent of Americans
					</a> lived in a household with guns in 2022.
				</p>
				<p id="xoicqw">Researchers have found a clear link between gun ownership in the US and gun violence, and some argue that it’s causal. One 2013 Boston University-led study,
					<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828709/"> for instance</a>, found that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership at the household level, the state firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9 percent. And states with weaker gun laws have higher rates of gun-related homicides and suicides, according to a
					<a href="https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/"> study</a> by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. 
				</p>
				<p id="EQ1cLQ">The link between gun deaths and gun ownership is much stronger than the link that
					<strong></strong>gun rights advocates often seek to draw
					<strong></strong>between violence and mental health issues. If it were possible to cure all schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders, violent crime in the US would
					<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/myth-vs-fact-violence-and-mental-health"> fall by only 4 percent</a>, according to a
					<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v4oSb2Na4nQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=swanson&amp;f=false"> study</a> from Duke University professor Jeffrey Swanson, who examines policies to reduce gun violence.
				</p>
				<p id="mUBWoP">There’s still a pervasive idea, pushed by gun manufacturers and gun rights organizations like the
					<a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/25/23140519/uvalde-school-shooting-nra-texas-good-guy-gun"> National Rifle Association</a>, that further arming America is the answer to preventing gun violence —
					<a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/25/23140519/uvalde-school-shooting-nra-texas-good-guy-gun"> the “good guy with a gun” theory</a>. But there have been relatively few instances in which police or armed bystanders have been able to successfully stop an active attack.
					<strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p id="URSBLi">According to a database maintained by Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University, there were 520 active attacks — 
					<a href="https://www.activeattackdata.org/index.html">defined</a> as when one or more people are “actively killing or attempting to kill multiple unrelated people in a public space,” including but not limited to shootings — between 2000 and 2022. In many of those cases, police were 
					<a href="https://www.activeattackdata.org/allattacks.html">unable to stop</a> the attacker, either because the attack had already ended by the time they arrived or because the attacker surrendered or committed suicide. Only in 160 cases were police able to successfully intervene by shooting or otherwise subduing the attacker.
				</p>

					<p id="8WRO9O">Another 2021 
						<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776515">study</a> from Hamline University and Metropolitan State University found that the rate of deaths in 133 mass school shootings between 1980 and 2019 was 2.83 times greater in cases where there was an armed guard present. The researchers argue the results suggest the presence of an armed guard increased shooters’ aggression and that because many school shooters have been found to be suicidal, “an armed officer may be an incentive rather than a deterrent.”
					</p>
					<p id="jWgibp">“The idea that the solution to mass shootings is that we need more guns in the hands of more people in more places so that we’ll be able to protect ourselves — there’s no evidence that that’s true,” Swanson said. </p>
					<p id="a070oM">The prevalence of the self-defense narrative is part of what sets apart the gun rights movement in the US from similar movements in places like Canada and Australia, according to Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland who studies the politics of gun control. </p>
					<p id="05FRv4">Self-defense has become by far the
						<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/"> most prominent reason</a> for gun ownership in the US today, eclipsing hunting, recreation, or owning guns because they’re antiques, heirlooms, or work-related. That’s also reflected in
						<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/us/politics/gun-manufacturing-atf.html"> ballooning handgun sales</a>, since the primary purpose of those guns isn’t recreational, but self-defense. 
					</p>
					<p id="LqVIqI">American gun culture “brings together the hunting-sporting tradition with the militia-frontier tradition, but in modern times the hunting element has been eclipsed by a heavily politicized notion that gun carrying is an expression of freedom, individuality, hostility to government, and personal self-protection,” Spitzer said. </p>

						<p id="mxItMo">That
							<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11975850/ar-15-owner-orlando"> culture of gun ownership in the US</a> has made it all the more difficult to explore serious policy solutions to gun violence after mass shootings. In high-income countries lacking that culture, mass shootings have historically galvanized public support behind gun control measures that would seem extreme by US standards. 
						</p>
						<p id="aoqzYW">Canada
							<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/03/23/mass-shootings-response-other-countries-gun-laws/"> banned military-style assault weapons</a> two weeks after a 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia. In 2019, less than a month after the Christchurch massacre, New Zealand lawmakers passed a gun buyback scheme, as well as restrictions on AR-15s and other semiautomatic weapons, and they later established a firearms registry. The 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Australia spurred the government to
							<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9212725/australia-buyback"> buy back 650,000 firearms</a> within a year, and murders and suicides plummeted as a result. 
						</p>
						<p id="rw1Khl">By contrast, nearly a decade went by after the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, before Congress passed a new gun control law. The
							<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/6/23/23180893/senate-gun-control-bipartisan-bill-2022-pass"> Bipartisan Safer Communities Act</a>, the law passed in June 2022, was relatively limited:
							<strong></strong>It incentivized states to pass red flag laws, enhanced background checks for gun buyers under 21, and closed the “boyfriend loophole,” which allowed some people with domestic violence convictions to purchase guns. But it did not ban any types of weapons, and certain studies suggest that even truly universal background checks may have 
							<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/27/18224727/house-universal-background-checks-gun-violence-congress">limited effects on gun violence</a>.
							<strong></strong>
						</p>
						<p id="qthrPL">At the same time, many states have sought to expand gun ownership in recent years. At least 27 states have now passed laws allowing residents to carry a 
							<a href="https://www.handgunlaw.us/documents/Permitless_Carry_States.pdf">handgun without a permit</a> and allow school staff and teachers to 
							<a href="https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/laws-allowing-armed-staff-in-K12-schools.html">carry guns on campus</a>. 
						</p>

							</figure>
							<p id="rNgOhz">“Other countries look at this problem and say, ‘People walking around in the community with handguns is just way too dangerous, so we’re going to broadly limit legal access to that and make exceptions on the margins for people who might have a good reason to have a gun,’” Swanson said. “Here we do just the opposite: We say that, because of the way that the Supreme Court interpreted the Second Amendment, everybody has the right to a gun for personal protection, and then we tried to make exceptions for really dangerous people, but we can’t figure out who they are.”</p>
							<p id="irgpOC">
								<a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/harvard-political-review/vast-majority-americans-support-universal-background-checks">While the majority of Americans</a> support more gun control restrictions, 
								<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">including universal background checks</a>, a vocal Republican minority unequivocally opposes such laws — and is willing to put pressure on GOP lawmakers to do the same. Alongside the NRA, and a well-funded gun lobby, this contingent of voters sees gun control as a deciding issue, and one that could warrant a primary challenge for a lawmaker who votes for it. 
							</p>
							<p id="8wKCli">The gun lobby has the advantage of enthusiasm. “​​Despite being outnumbered, Americans who oppose gun control are more likely to contact public officials about it and to base their votes on it,” Barnard College’s Matthew Lacombe 
								<a href="https://barnard.edu/news/break-down-gun-politics-america">explained in 2020</a>. “As a result, many politicians believe that supporting gun regulation is more likely to lose them votes than to gain them votes.”

								</figure>
								<h3 id="x5gwWU">The Supreme Court has made it impossible to cure America’s gun violence epidemic</h3>
								<p id="PwxNBc">In 2008, the Supreme Court effectively wrote NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre’s “good guy with a gun” theory into the Constitution. The Court’s 5-4 decision in
									<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html">
										<em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>
									</a> (2008) was the first Supreme Court decision in American history to hold that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm. But it also went much further than that.
								</p>
								<p id="aWby7X">
									<em>Heller</em> held that one of the primary purposes of the Second Amendment is to protect the right of individuals — good guys with a gun, in LaPierre’s framework — to use firearms to stop bad guys with guns. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in 
									<em>Heller</em>, an “inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.”
								</p>
								<p id="mctR9F">As a matter of textual interpretation, this holding makes no sense. The Second Amendment provides that “
									<a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-ii">a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State</a>, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” 
								</p>
								<p id="uuTZgL">We don’t need to guess why the Second Amendment protects a right to firearms because it is right there in the Constitution. The Second Amendment’s purpose is to preserve “a well-regulated Militia,” not to allow individuals to use their weapons for personal self-defense.</p>
								<p id="b4k6DP">For many years, the Supreme Court took the first 13 words of the Second Amendment seriously. As the Court said in
									<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174">
										<em>United States v. Miller</em>
									</a>
									<em></em>(1939), the “obvious purpose” of the Second Amendment was to “render possible the effectiveness” of militias. And thus the amendment must be “interpreted and applied with that end in view.” 
									<em>Heller</em> abandoned that approach.
								</p>
								<p id="sGVwGs">
									<em>Heller</em> also reached another important policy conclusion. Handguns, according to Scalia, are “overwhelmingly chosen” by gun owners who wish to carry a firearm for self-defense. For this reason, he wrote, handguns enjoy a kind of super-legal status. Lawmakers are not allowed to ban what Scalia described as “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use for protection of one’s home and family.”
								</p>
								<p id="SR5QS5">This declaration regarding handguns matters because this easily concealed weapon is responsible for far more deaths than any other weapon in the United States — and it isn’t close. In 2021, for example, a 
									<a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/shr">total of 14,616 people were murdered in the US</a>, according to the FBI. Of these murder victims, at least 5,992 — just over 40 percent — were killed by handguns.
								</p>

									</figure>
									<p id="LcMVNg">Last year, the Supreme Court made it even harder for federal and state lawmakers to combat gun violence. In its decision in
										<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf">
											<em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em>
										</a>
										<em>, </em>it massively expands the scope of the Second Amendment, abandons more than a decade of case law governing which gun laws are permitted by the Constitution, and replaces this case law with a new legal framework that, as Justice Stephen Breyer writes in dissent, “imposes a task on the lower courts that judges cannot easily accomplish.”
									</p>
									<p id="wCmPAt">
										<em>Bruen </em>has since allowed handguns — which are responsible for the 
										<a href="https://www.vox.com/22382180/supreme-court-uvalde-guns-violence-second-amendment-heller-scalia">overwhelming majority of gun murders</a> in the United States — to proliferate on many American streets. That’s because 
										<em>Bruen</em> strikes the types of laws that limit who can legally carry handguns in public, holding that “the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.” Amid a flurry of activity in the courts over the last year, 
										<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/07/28/bruen-supreme-court-rahimi-00108285">more than a dozen state and federal gun control laws </a>have been invalidated in whole or in part as a result.
									</p>
									<p id="Zbm2Hq">Under this new legal regime, the future of firearm regulation looks grim for anyone who believes that the government should help protect us from gun violence.</p>

										<strong></strong>that would allow for a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown, but the best-laid plans ...)
									</p>
									<p id="2AvEYF">Overall, though, Johnson is a movement conservative close to the Christian right. He’s also a stalwart Trump ally who 
										<a href="https://twitter.com/costareports/status/1717170722198438007">actively worked to help</a> the former president try to overturn 
										<a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden" data-source="encore">Joe Biden</a>’s victories in key 2020 swing states — making Trump, who helped torch the chances of Johnson’s leading rival Tom Emmer on Tuesday, another winner.
									</p>
									<p id="OiXtfJ">The losers include the existing slate of House GOP leaders, all of whom took embarrassing public L’s over the past few weeks. And while a bloc of mainstream Republicans got some satisfaction in taking down Jim Jordan, they decided to stop there rather than flexing their muscles further — meaning that the party leadership has ultimately gotten further away from them.</p>
									<h3 id="dTbQMA">Winner (for now): Mike Johnson</h3>

										</figure>
										<p id="1ksJZW">When this saga started 22 days ago, no one would have predicted that it would end with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. And yet it has.</p>
										<p id="Av4YCj">Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016, which would make him the least experienced speaker 
											<a href="https://twitter.com/ChadPergram/status/1717182604787499110">since the 1880s</a>. Yet for close House watchers, Johnson didn’t totally come out of nowhere. Since 2021, he’s been the fifth-ranking member of the House GOP leadership’s team, serving as vice chair of the conference. Before that, Johnson chaired the Republican Study Committee — an organizing body of House conservatives who are mostly not far-right enough to be in the Freedom Caucus.
										</p>
										<p id="OEjWOg">But now he’s suddenly speaker, in large part because all the other contenders who were more prominent than him — McCarthy, Steve Scalise (R-LA), Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Tom Emmer (R-MN) — had made too many enemies. Since it currently takes a mere five Republican defections to sink a GOP speaker nominee on the House floor, having few haters in the party is actually more important than having passionate supporters. </p>
										<p id="G7PHrN">Hence Speaker Johnson. But is the speakership a poisoned chalice, destined to result in the demise of anyone who drinks from it? The core problem that has bedeviled GOP speakers since John Boehner is that there is a faction of hardliners on the right who seem fundamentally unsuited to the reality of governance and especially to the compromises necessary when Democrats control the White House and Senate.</p>
										<p id="hKPeAc">Speaker Johnson has no secret plan to force President Biden and 60 senators to bend the knee and accept massive cuts to government spending. He may be 
											<a href="https://twitter.com/RepHageman/status/1716898450460283064/photo/1">talking a big game </a>about passing 12 separate appropriations bills with Republican votes, but McCarthy made that same promise in January and found it impossible to fulfill. And inevitably, a spending deal has to be cut with Democrats, or the government shuts down and Republicans get blamed, imperiling their chances of holding the chamber in 2024. 
										</p>
										<p id="y2k4SH">Johnson’s best hope is that he can convince the hardliners to chill out for a bit and give him more leeway to cut those deals than they gave McCarthy. But the longer he remains in the speaker job, the more he’ll inevitably disappoint some Republicans. And it is worth noting that he has never done this job before. Can he do it?</p>
										<h3 id="7yIF3t">Winner: GOP hardliners</h3>
										<p id="xIDOy6">Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who started this whole ball rolling by moving to oust McCarthy, 
											<a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1717198721178357949">summed up his takeaway</a> on Steve Bannon’s podcast Wednesday: “If you don’t think that moving from Kevin McCarthy to MAGA Mike Johnson shows the ascendance of this movement and where the power in the Republican Party truly lies, then you’re not paying attention.”
										</p>
										<p id="Fcj6QL">Indeed, Republican hardliners didn’t get the Speaker Jim Jordan that they dreamed of. But they firmly established the principle that the hard right is entitled to veto any speaker nominee the conference produces — and they torched the careers of all of the top three “establishment” party leaders. Not a bad month’s work.</p>
										<p id="o0EQDy">Johnson’s surprising ascendance is also a win for the Christian right. While Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy all supported conservative 
											<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy" data-source="encore">policies</a> and viewed the religious right as an essential part of the GOP coalition, Johnson is 
											<em>of</em> that movement: Before entering elected office, he 
											<a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/10/new-house-speaker-nominee-mike-johnson-is-an-anti-lgbtq-extremist-who-once-worked-for-a-hate-group/">was a top lawyer</a> for a Christian legal advocacy group and has long opposed 
											<a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion" data-source="encore">abortion</a> rights and 
											<a href="https://www.vox.com/lgbtq" data-source="encore">LGBTQ</a> rights. (In contrast, Emmer was sunk in part because he 
											<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/republicans-who-voted-same-sex-marriage.html#:~:text=sex%2Dmarriage.html-,The%2039%20House%20Republicans%20Who%20Voted%20for%20the%20Same%2DSex,it%20passed%20over%20the%20summer.">had voted</a> in favor of 
											<a href="https://www.vox.com/marriage-equality" data-source="encore">marriage equality</a> — one holdout House Republican told him Tuesday that 
											<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/room-gasped-during-bible-thumping-235532270.html">he needed to</a> “get right with Jesus.”)
										</p>
										<p id="RNy5Bb">The practical impact of Johnson’s conservatism will be limited so long as Democrats control the Senate and the White House. A more conservative speaker does not necessarily translate to more conservative laws. But the right-wing hardliners have proven that while they may not yet fully control the party, they’re now the most powerful force inside it.</p>

											<p id="CiuFcq">McCarthy was tossed out of his job by just eight defecting Republicans (who joined with all Democrats to oust him as speaker). Then Scalise, after winning an internal GOP conference vote, 
												<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/10/12/23914703/house-speaker-race-steve-scalise-republicans-jim-jordan">lasted barely more than a day</a> as speaker nominee before quitting. And this week, Emmer exceeded even that — he was the speaker nominee for just four hours before dropping out. 
											</p>

												</figure>
												<p id="KTCTHW">Trump was mostly a minor player in the House speaker race — the GOP hardliners don’t need his encouragement to make trouble for party leaders. But while he didn’t end up with Speaker Jordan (his initial endorsement), he may have ended up with the next best thing. </p>
												<p id="fAFxWP">“Johnson was deeply involved in efforts to keep Trump in power starting immediately after 2020 election,” the Washington Post’s Robert Costa 
													<a href="https://twitter.com/costareports/status/1717170722198438007">tweeted</a>. “Johnson — then all but unknown — worked with allied Trump groups and conservative leaders in a coordinated way to make sure that whole orbit was working together to help Trump.”
												</p>
												<p id="hsHgoX">Early on, Johnson 
													<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/house-speaker-republican-mike-johnson-january-6-mastermind-trump-election-2020.html">publicly</a> made false claims that voting machines were “rigged.” In December, he used his constitutional law expertise to put together a legalistic justification for throwing out Biden’s wins in key swing states — he 
													<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163550/20201211132250339_Texas%20v.%20Pennsylvania%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20126%20Representatives%20--%20corrected.pdf">claimed</a> that state voting policy changes implemented during the pandemic were illegal unless they went through state legislatures, and got more than 100 House Republicans to sign on to the argument. He stuck by that argument 
													<a href="https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=715">up to January 6 itself</a>, and even when 
													<a href="https://www.vox.com/congress" data-source="encore">Congress</a> reconvened after the attacks, he 
													<a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/6/22218058/republicans-objections-election-results">voted to</a> throw out Biden’s wins.
												</p>
												<p id="f7LdF8">Trump also played a role in the denouement of the crisis. Emmer had initially defeated Johnson for the speaker nomination midday Tuesday, but he’s long had a tense relationship with Trump. And while Emmer was struggling to win over hardliner holdouts, Trump publicly blasted Emmer as a “
													<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-emmer-globalist-rino-warns-republicans-would-be-tragic-mistake-elect-him-speaker">Globalist RINO</a>,” in what may have been the nail in the coffin for his bid. Now, he has a true loyalist in the speaker’s chair rather than someone backing him through gritted teeth.
												</p>
												<h3 id="SHZhD2">Loser: Anyone dreaming about bipartisanship</h3>
												<p id="kvTA7x">As Republicans struggled for so long to achieve near-unanimity to elect a speaker, many observers asked an obvious question: Why couldn’t some Republicans cut a deal with some Democrats to pick a speaker, and govern the House from the center?</p>
												<p id="uRiUft">Various ideas to this effect were batted around — the one that gained the most steam was for an “empowerment” of temporary speaker Patrick McHenry for a set period of time. But it proved to be toxic among Republicans. It drew fury from conservative media, and GOP leaders distanced themselves from any idea of a “coalition government.”</p>
												<p id="2pjb1l">A Washington Post editorial 
													<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/24/tom-emmer-republicans-house-speaker-democrats/">blamed Democrats</a> for failing to throw a reasonable Republican their votes. But that argument missed the point — the relatively more “reasonable” Republican options, Scalise and Emmer, never actually went to the House floor, instead quitting beforehand. For Emmer in particular, there had been chatter that some Democrats might throw him their votes or vote present. But he evidently didn’t 
													<em>want</em> to be elected as a speaker with Democratic votes, since that would forever mark him as a party traitor. Partisanship and polarization remain ascendant.
												</p>
												<p id="79ZmK2">This is also why the mainstream bloc of Republican holdouts ultimately lost their staring contest with the hardliners. The ultimate leverage the mainstreamers could have deployed would have been a threat to deal with Democrats. But they all have Republican primaries they want to win, Republican donors they want to woo, and Republican social worlds they inhabit. A deal with Democrats would likely have meant the end of their own political careers, and evidently no one wanted to take that risk.</p>
												<h3 id="OU8kuv">Loser: The stability of the US electoral system</h3>
												<p id="QOVCY9">After Johnson won the GOP conference’s speaker nomination Tuesday night, one reporter 
													<a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1717013355775545630">asked him about</a> having led Trump’s challenges to the 2020 election results. The assembled GOP leadership team booed, with one member yelling “shut up!” Johnson demurred: “Next question.”
												</p>
												<p id="ruTj56">In January 2021, when Trump was trying to stay in power, the House of Representatives was under Democratic control, so the actions of House Republicans didn’t matter all too much. Most of them could vote to throw out Biden’s wins in key states, but they didn’t have a majority, so they couldn’t actually 
													<em>do</em> that.
												</p>
												<p id="iRLcnt">January 2025 could be different. The House that meets to certify the presidential election results that month will be newly elected, but Johnson could well still be speaker. If so — and if there’s a similar dispute where Trump is denying a Biden victory — it’s far from clear what Johnson will do.</p>
												<p id="BJpJMc">Generally, from November 2020 through January 2021, the Republican Party behaved terribly irresponsibly, but just enough Republicans in positions of power did the right thing — 
													<a href="https://www.vox.com/22230929/trump-coup-why-failed-capitol-storming">certifying the results</a> at some political cost. Since then, critics of Trump’s attempt to seize power have largely been purged from the party, and election denial has been increasingly normalized. For instance, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), an idiosyncratic conservative, 
													<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/11/republican-speaker-vote-ken-buck-2020-election">said he initially</a> wouldn’t support a speaker candidate who denied the election results — but he backed Johnson anyway.
												</p>
												<p id="lYAj0N">Would a GOP-controlled House certify a Democratic victory in the 
													<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections" data-source="encore">2024 presidential election</a>? With Johnson in charge, that may have grown less likely — and that has ominous implications for the state of American democracy.

															<strong></strong>the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean’s temperature cycle, has been especially strong this year, driving 
															<a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23807520/heat-wave-record-temperature-history-death-valley-climate">global air</a> and 
															<a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23762529/atlantic-ocean-record-heat-wave-el-nino-hurricane-climate-change">ocean temperatures</a> to levels never before recorded. Hurricanes require sea surface temperatures of 80 degrees Fahrenheit or more to form, so hotter weather tends to favor more hurricanes. In the Atlantic Ocean, El Niño also tends to create wind shear — wind coming from different directions or at different speeds — which usually suppresses hurricane formation, but the water temperatures have been so hot that hurricane activity in the Atlantic has still been

															<p id="B4Pxpx">Hurricane Otis, the 15th named storm in the eastern Pacific this year, spooled up right in the patch of warmer water around the equator that characterizes El Niño.</p>
															<p id="eHfa8o">The area was also prime real estate for rapid intensification. For Otis, the “key ingredient” for intensification was warm water, with temperatures 
																<a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/video/why-did-hurricane-otis-rapidly-intensify-into-a-category-5-0">topping 86 degrees Fahrenheit</a>, said 
																<a href="https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/aboutme.html">Brian McNoldy</a>, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. By this time in October, the Pacific Ocean had soaked up plenty of heat all summer long, so there was abundant warm water at the surface and several feet below to feed Otis. A day or two before the storm intensified there was some wind shear and patches of dry air — which can disrupt the formation of a strong storm — but they subsided just enough by late Tuesday for Otis to explode, McNoldy said.

															<h3 id="lEmEOl">Scientists are getting better at predicting rapid intensification, but the baseline is changing</h3>
															<p id="7Q63LW">The ingredients of rapid intensification can be difficult to measure with satellites in remote regions of the ocean where hurricanes form. These factors are also complicated to incorporate in models, making it difficult to predict when a disturbance will suddenly turn into a monster.

															<p>Melissa Bell moves into advisory role, Nisha Chittal named Chief of Staff </p>
															<p id="BnWYeQ">Today, Melissa Bell announced that she will be stepping down as publisher of Vox, and that editor-in-chief Swati Sharma will take on the expanded role of editor-in-chief and publisher of Vox, reporting to Vox Media president Pam Wasserstein. In addition, Nisha Chittal has been named chief of staff. Bell shared the following in a note to Vox staff: </p>
															<p id="5uJHMW">“In my two-plus decades of journalism, I have worked with many talented managers, journalists, and visionaries, but Swati is a rare combination of all three. She joined two years ago to oversee our text team, and carefully and thoughtfully expanded her remit across audio and video to set up an incredible operation with a unified team, a rigorous approach to our journalism, and a strong vision for where Vox needs to go next. She is a deeply empathetic leader who focuses on each individual’s strengths and pushes for a better Vox every day. Swati will report to Pam Wasserstein as first and foremost our Editor-in-Chief, and now as Publisher too. She’ll also work more closely with Jim Bankoff. I’m very excited for her to step into this more expansive role.</p>
															<p id="aIhNzx">To help set Vox up for our next decade, Nisha Chittal will be stepping into a Chief of Staff role to help run the operations of the full, unified newsrooms, oversee our long-term editorial planning, as well as manage our Network Development team. Nisha has been an incredible leader at Vox, always finding ways to make us more efficient, more communicative. She has helped us become a stronger and better newsroom, and I’m thrilled to see her expand her purview at Vox and influence even more parts of this organization. </p>
															<p id="r4tT3x">After ten incredible years working on Vox, I am stepping back from my role as publisher and becoming an advisor to the company…I want Vox to be an institution of lasting value – a place that outlasts its founders. And after the fast-paced intensity of our start-up, I have craved time to step back and be able to take a broader look at our industry and, hopefully, find new ways to help Vox lead the next revolution in our relationship to the news. I would never, ever feel like I could step back from this role if I didn’t have as much confidence as I do now about the future of Vox, and that’s because of all of you here, and because of Swati’s leadership. </p>
															<p id="w8tmTJ">This tiny idea I threw around with a few friends at a dirty dive bar in DC one night has become a massive change agent for our industry not because of any one of us, but because all of us here, and many other wonderful people who have worked here over the years. You took some part of our idea and made it smarter, sharper, more necessary. You made it into television programs, podcasts that air on 100 radio stations around the country, videos viewed around the world. You made it into a deep trove of necessary articles and points of reference, centering on our audience and their needs. </p>
															<p id="Sm4vVD">This is a challenging time for the media – but when is it not a challenging time for the media? And still, Vox has built a steadfast role for ourselves in the media firmament. There are a few reasons for our success that I want to call out. First, we are conscientious about our business at all times, even when, and particularly when, we have to make tough priority decisions to manage the changing market. Second, we center our audience; we don’t write for our peers or some small select group of thought leaders. Our peers and thought leaders read, listen, and watch us 
																<em>because</em> we write for everyone to understand the world – including them, but not just for them. We are accessible – not just thanks to our lack of a paywall – but because of our writing, our voices, our commitment to not just reporting the news, but making it something people want to engage with. Finally, we center our own humanity. We are real people with real voices – and we care for one another just as we care for our mission and our audience.
															</p>
															<p id="6IMxDh">I will be your fiercest fan and support system forever. I am and will forever be grateful that I get to be a part of this team, and work alongside some of the most creative, most hard-working, most mission-driven people in the business.</p>
															<p id="WLn9ML">I can’t wait to see what you all do next. Thank you for giving me the best experience of my professional life.”</p>

															<p>Why doctors are so stressed out, depressed, and suicidal — and what can be done about it.</p>
															<p id="9SWiOh"></p>
															<p id="H6r463">

															<p id="qj8jYu"></p>
															<p id="6lf2qD"></p>
															<p id="tqjZ05"></p>
															<p id="E5n4m1">Twice a week, Boston-area psychiatrist Elissa Ely volunteers at a US anonymous 
																<a href="https://www.physiciansupportline.com/">help line</a> for physicians in crisis. The calls she takes are often from people in deep distress — physicians having panic attacks, abusing substances or alcohol, facing divorce or alienation from family and friends. A typical call, she said, could be from “an ER doctor who vomits before she goes in for her shifts; despair and depression; suicidality.”
															</p>
															<p id="3FYndU">But despite her callers’ high levels of mental distress, they’re often very resistant to her suggestions that they seek mental health care, said Ely. When she suggests doctors consider even just a “tincture” of an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, or find a therapist, she inevitably gets the same response, a long pause followed by a question: “Is this call really anonymous?” </p>
															<p id="JoNbhR">She understands why so many respond this way. “These physicians are living in terror of losing their essential identity or losing their lives that they have created, and of losing their licenses,” she said. That fear isn’t unreasonable: Until recently, 
																<a href="https://drlornabreen.org/removebarriers/">answering questions about current or prior mental health treatment</a> was a condition of being allowed to work in most states and health care facilities. 
															</p>
															<p id="WcZR19">Medicine has historically been a high-stress profession, and doctors have for decades faced 
																<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20786190.2019.1610232">higher depression and burnout risk</a> than the rest of the population. But the pandemic amplified that risk: On October 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a 
																<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7244e1.htm?s_cid=mm7244e1_w">report</a> detailing “crisis levels” of health worker burnout. The agency’s analysis indicates that, compared with other workers surveyed between 2018 and 2022, health workers had a bigger decline in mental health and were more likely to report worsening working conditions. 
															</p>
															<p id="KDah5i">The report didn’t distinguish between different types of health care workers. However, other surveys suggest doctors are experiencing some of the worst work-related mental health concerns. In one 2021 
																<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(22)00515-8/fulltext#%20">national survey</a>, the percent of doctors with at least one manifestation of burnout increased by 43 percent from the pre-Covid-19 era — and these trends appear to be holding in 2023. 
															</p>
															<p id="rmVpna">At the same time, doctors are less likely to seek treatment for mental health concerns for a variety of reasons. The pushback Ely hears is common: Many physicians say that despite their comfort with prescribing mental health treatment and care to patients, seeking mental health care for themselves remains highly stigmatized.</p>
															<p id="nubQ2q">Meanwhile, major shifts in many doctors’ practice environments mean they have less and less control over how and how much they work — leading to 
																<a href="https://physiciansfoundation.org/research/amplifying-physician-resident-and-student-voices-to-drive-wellbeing-and-care-delivery-solutions/">even more work-related distress</a>. 
															</p>
															<p id="BTBt55">It all adds up to a situation that’s bad for both doctors and
																<em></em>patients: As providers have increasing levels of mental distress, they’re more likely to leave medical practice. That’s a particularly bad outcome given 
																<a href="https://www.vox.com/23817170/family-doctor-primary-care-physician-general-practitioner-shortage">the serious physician shortages </a>the US health care system is already facing.
															</p>
															<p id="KHJlhS">There are ways to improve doctors’ access to mental health treatment, and to at least somewhat reduce the upstream causes of their anguish. Those efforts require effort and time — but to anyone who cares about the US health care system and the people working within it, they’re well worth knowing about.</p>
															<h3 id="BJSwc9">What’s causing such high levels of mental distress among doctors?</h3>
															<p id="hoReJh">Physicians have high rates of mental distress — and they’re only getting higher. One 2023 survey found 
																<a href="https://physiciansfoundation.org/research/amplifying-physician-resident-and-student-voices-to-drive-wellbeing-and-care-delivery-solutions/">six out of 10 doctors often had feelings of burnout</a>, compared to four out of 10 pre-pandemic. In a separate 2023 study, nearly a quarter of doctors said they were 
																<a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058?faf=1#2">depressed</a>. 
															</p>
															<p id="JG28G6">Physicians die by suicide at rates 
																<a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2295">higher than the general population</a>, with women’s risk twice as high as men’s. In a 2022 survey, 
																<a href="https://www.mdlinx.com/article/2022-physician-suicide-report-a-bleak-reality/6dfsXJCfBxBteoxA44mDMG">one in 10 doctors</a> said they’d thought about or attempted suicide.
															</p>
															<p id="beFTUP">Not all doctors are at equal risk: 
																<a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058?faf=1#3">Primary care providers</a> — like emergency medicine, internal medicine, and pediatrics practitioners — are most likely to say they’re burned out, and 
																<a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058?faf=1#4">female</a> physicians experience burnout at higher rates than male physicians.

																	<div data-anthem-component="aside:12101641"></div>
																</div>
															</div>
															<p id="DAgaJt">(It’s worth noting that other health care professionals — perhaps most prominently 
																<a href="https://www.amnhealthcare.com/amn-insights/nursing/surveys/2023/">nurses</a> — also face high levels of mental distress. But because nurses are more frequently unionized than doctors and because their professional culture isn’t the same as doctor culture, the causes and solutions are also somewhat different.)
															</p>
															<p id="SR3mL8">Why do these health care providers have such high rates of mental health distress?</p>
															<p id="UiK20w">The answers fall under two big umbrellas, said 
																<a href="https://www.physiciansupportline.com/our-team">Mona Masood</a>, a psychiatrist who founded the physician support hotline where Ely volunteers. One is a 
																<a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/burnout-threat-primary-care-workforce-doctor-mental-health/">professional culture</a> that prizes efficiency, perfection, and self-sacrifice. Another is “moral injury” — the damaging effects of witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent things that don’t align with the values that drew people to practicing medicine. 
															</p>
															<p id="sxgz10">One example of moral injury is the massive amount of time doctors spend dealing with prior authorizations and insurance companies — and being blamed by patients for the financial strain caused by the US’s 
																<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/10/16/23894085/health-insurance-open-enrollment-medical-dental-medicare-obamacare">broken</a>
																<a href="https://www.vox.com/23890764/healthcare-insurance-marketplace-open-enrollment-employer-sponsored-united-blue-cross-shield-aetna">health</a>
																<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/3/17/23639685/medicare-medicaid-plans-health-insurance-open-enrollment-privatization">insurance</a>
																<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/23892823/healthcare-flexible-spending-account-fsa-hsa-wageworks">system</a>. In one study, 61 percent of doctors said the main cause of their burnout was “
																<a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058?faf=1#6">too many bureaucratic tasks</a>,” and another survey by the Physicians Foundation found 
																<a href="https://physiciansfoundation.org/research/amplifying-physician-resident-and-student-voices-to-drive-wellbeing-and-care-delivery-solutions/">reducing administrative burdens</a> was the most effective solution for improving physician well-being.
															</p>
															<p id="ayyGQZ">Many physicians spend unpaid hours each day — the equivalent of 
																<a href="https://www.annfammed.org/content/15/5/419.full">nearly a full unpaid day each week</a> — on “pajama time,” doctor slang for the time they spend documenting patient care in the chart from home. It’s not what they thought they signed up for when they went to medical school, and it’s 
																<a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/burnout-benchmark-28-unhappy-current-health-care-job">bad for their mental health</a>.
															</p>
															<p id="Ck1q4O">Doctors also blame 
																<a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058?faf=1#6">other factors</a> for emotional strain — most notably the lack of respect from coworkers, long working hours, and inadequate pay. But their overall impact is lower in comparison.
															</p>
															<p id="5DtT87">Mistreatment on the job may also play an under-recognized role in driving declining mental health among physicians. In the newly published CDC report, health workers reported the largest increase in 
																<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s1024-Health-Worker-Mental-Health.html">workplace harassment</a> of all types of workers surveyed. Regardless of its source — whether it was colleagues, patients, or patients’ families perpetrating the abuse — workplace harassment dramatically increased the odds of health worker anxiety, depression, or burnout.

																<h3 id="BzeNZe">Doctors are under incredible stress. But they also feel stigmatized for getting help. </h3>
																<p id="tijfa9">It’s a terrible bit of irony that for a profession subject to so many stressors, there are also so many barriers to getting relief. </p>
																<p id="05cx3k">As Masood points out, the medical profession stigmatizes seeking mental health care among physicians: In the Physicians Foundation survey, about 
																	<a href="https://physiciansfoundation.org/research/amplifying-physician-resident-and-student-voices-to-drive-wellbeing-and-care-delivery-solutions/">half</a> of all doctors had a peer who wouldn’t seek mental health care, and four out of five agreed there was substantial stigma around getting mental health care within their profession.
																</p>
																<p id="Z3D9aP">That stigma isn’t just an imagined fear. Institutional practices in effect punish physicians for seeking care, often with horrible consequences. </p>
																<p id="tvXpdr">Before emergency medicine doctor 
																	<a href="https://drlornabreen.org/about-lorna/">Lorna Breen</a> died by suicide early in the Covid-19 pandemic, she’d been overworked into a nearly catatonic state, hardly able to move or speak. 
																</p>
																<p id="v2QYPr">A few days into treatment — Breen’s first time ever receiving mental health care — she expressed fear “that now that she’d obtained mental health treatment this was going to ruin the career that she’d worked for her entire life,” said her brother-in-law, Corey Feist. Her family thought her fears were unfounded, but after her death, they learned that, in fact, Breen was partially right. </p>
																<p id="s2WrzW">Most state medical licensing boards — but, in a tragic twist of irony, said Feist, not New York’s — required physicians to disclose current or prior mental health care. Many hospitals require the same before credentialing a physician to practice there. While that information might not be used to prevent a physician from practicing, the mere perception that it might is a source of stigma. </p>
																<p id="8tUnXe">Breen was not alone: About 40 percent of doctors in the Physicians Foundation survey were either afraid or knew another physician who was afraid of seeking mental health care due to questions on medical licensure, credentialing, and insurance applications. </p>
																<p id="X4X6e5">For doctors, work-related mental health strain 
																	<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/a-treatment-for-americas-healthcare-worker-burnout/">strongly</a>
																	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563836/">predicts</a> their desire to leave the profession. And quitting kick-starts a doom loop: The more who leave, the bigger the workload for the doctors left behind — and the higher the risk that they, in turn, will burn out. 
																</p>
																<p id="JgflT4">Play this cycle out a few times and it’s clear: If left unaddressed, the conditions that create burnout and depression, and create barriers to their prevention and treatment, could ultimately hollow out the medical profession.</p>
																<h3 id="dpbAJO">How to improve doctors’ mental health </h3>
																<p id="9zyN3b">Meaningfully reducing physician depression and burnout requires smoothing the path to care for mental health distress — but also addressing its root causes.</p>
																<p id="GML1yY">Getting any kind of health care can be complicated in the US, but companies that employ doctors can take steps to make accessing mental health care a little easier. A 2022 
																	<a href="https://www.aha.org/workforce-strategies/supporting-behavioral-health">American Hospital Association report</a> includes a laundry list of questions intended to help hospital leadership determine how and whether their employees can access mental health care treatment — everything from “Are providers taking new patients?” to “Does your sick leave policy address behavioral health disorders?
																</p>
																<p id="1TNwra">Changing or removing invasive questions about mental health when doctors apply for 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/labor-jobs" data-source="encore">jobs</a> or licensure is also key for improving access to care. After Breen died, her sister and brother-in-law founded the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes Foundation, in part to advocate for these changes. As a result of its work, 
																	<a href="https://drlornabreen.org/removebarriers/">more than 25 state licensing boards</a> have removed intrusive questions about mental health from their applications, and 11 more are in the process of doing so. 
																</p>
																<p id="lV0oQR">“This is good,” said Ely, the psychiatrist who staffs the physician crisis hotline. “But that still leaves half the country whose physicians are living in fear.” </p>
																<p id="T9F4AQ">Outside of these questionnaire changes, Masood identifies two key tools for improving physician mental health.</p>
																<p id="Hai5jL">The first one is peer support, which can come in the form of hotlines like the one Masood runs, grassroots groups like 
																	<a href="https://physiciancoachsupport.com/">Physician Coach Support</a>, and 
																	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8263025/">programs</a> run by health care systems. The point of these programs is to engage physicians in identifying and providing support for mental distress among colleagues. Health care systems that have them train their employees to recognize and respond one-on-one to signs of emotional harm in each other.
																</p>
																<p id="uo0f07">These peer support programs can also help reduce the unsafe working conditions that often trigger the harm to begin with, said 
																	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-van-pelt-md-mba-a1180110/">Rick van Pelt</a>, who leads quality improvement initiatives at the University of Alabama Birmingham. 
																</p>
																<p id="PkGPgY">Medical errors and unexpected bad outcomes of care are among the 
																	<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29366616">most potent triggers of mental health crisis</a> in physicians. So an environment where people aren’t afraid to quickly acknowledge medical errors, said van Pelt, also helps manage the emotions those errors generate. Health care facilities that have those kinds of environments — ones that encourage transparency and responsiveness to medical errors — also have 
																	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK225179/">better patient safety records</a>.
																</p>
																<p id="nlGhkX">Simply put: Working in a place that’s safer for doctors is also safer for patients. </p>
																<p id="Of6Zol">The second key tool, Masood points out, is getting providers engaged in untangling the twisted and inefficient processes that most waste their time. Van Pelt studies one approach to this, which involves creating “accountable care teams” (ACTs) that work together to identify and solve the patient care hiccups that lead to worse outcomes for both doctors and patients. </p>
																<p id="ax3MYL">Van Pelt gave an example from his work with the University of Alabama’s trauma unit, the state’s only Level I trauma center. The unit often had to turn away patients because it was full. A solution: reducing its patients’ 
																	<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784338">length of stay</a> to free up more beds. An ACT led to changes that shortened the units’ stays by an average of a day and a half — so successful that the hospital was able to 
																	<a href="https://www.uab.edu/reporter/patient-care/advances/item/9700-3d-problem-solving-means-listening-tearing-down-silos-and-sending-people-home-happy">stop routinely turning away patients</a>. 
																</p>
																<p id="gTxdDo">When the pandemic started, van Pelt and other researchers at the university were just starting to study how well ACTs worked to improve hospital processes. What they found was that involvement in the teams “served as an element of psychological PPE,” or personal protective equipment, protecting the psyche in the same way that a mask and gloves protect the body, said 
																	<a href="https://www.uab.edu/shp/hsa/graduate/doctor-of-philosophy-phd/faculty-staff/katherine-meese">Katherine Meese</a>, the organizational behavior researcher who directs the university’s health care management and leadership center. 
																</p>
																<p id="zTJrAN">Compared with their colleagues, health care providers on the medical center’s ACT teams 
																	<a href="https://jhmhp.amegroups.org/article/view/7331/html">scored higher on measures of autonomy</a> and several other metrics that predict worker well-being.
																</p>
																<p id="EMtw6x">American public health authorities seem to recognize that to improve health care workers’ mental health, those workers need to be part of the solution. In a press conference October 24, CDC representatives announced its 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) would soon launch a national campaign aimed to help hospital leaders think differently about how to improve their providers’ mental health. A central recommendation would engage providers in making decisions about how their work gets done, said 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/ddsp.html">Debra Houry</a>, the CDC’s chief medical officer.
																</p>
																<p id="bsV1ko">Additionally, health care institutions must do more to reduce employee harassment, which currently is “really epidemic,” said 
																	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/l-casey-chosewood-md-mph-02991417/">L. Casey Chosewood</a>, an occupational health expert at NIOSH. That means increasing training and resources for people who experience harassment, taking harassment complaints seriously, and being transparent with staff when harassment happens. 
																</p>
																<p id="7egf3C">“So often when we think about mental health, we’re thinking about resources” like counseling or yoga, said Meese. “We’re not always as attuned to fixing the work” — that is, lightening the massive administrative burdens so many doctors bear. </p>
																<p id="Bdqczx">But fixing the work is one of the key ways to increase health care workers’ baseline mental health. “We know that a connection to meaning and purpose in the work is important, especially as a part of mental health. Can we get friction out of the way of that connection?” said Meese.</p>
																<p id="9dZP10">It behooves us to try, said Ely. “In the end, everything we do comes down to self-interest. And if you don’t take care of physicians, they are not going to be able to take care of us,” she said.</p>

																<p>The broken US health care system is a long-term barrier to Beyfortus access.</p>
																<p id="WQeetE">On October 13, the drug manufacturer Sanofi made a surprising 
																	<a href="https://www.news.sanofi.us/Sanofi-Beyfortus-Statement">announcement</a>: Public demand for Beyfortus — the brand name of nirsevimab, the company’s new product aimed at protecting newborns from severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections — had wildly outpaced supply.
																</p>
																<p id="nqpE6D">In some ways, that’s good news: This is the first RSV season that the drug has been available, and uptake has been high. Understandably so: RSV is the top cause of infant hospitalizations 
																	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592248/">worldwide</a>. Pediatricians have enthusiastically welcomed this fall’s avalanche of new vaccines and other products to help prevent the infection’s worst outcomes. And despite the 
																	<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01693-2/fulltext">fleeting rise</a> in childhood vaccine hesitancy that took place during the pandemic, parents still 
																	<a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2023-062927/194471/The-COVID-19-Pandemic-and-Parental-Attitudes">trust and listen to pediatricians about vaccines</a>.
																</p>
																<p id="Srkp3u">But it also means some children have been unable to receive the immunization, and it reveals deeper, more structural problems with how the US administers childhood vaccinations.</p>
																<p id="fh9HTY">In response to the shortage, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
																	<a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00499.asp">recommended</a> on Monday that the drug be prioritized for the youngest and highest-risk babies due to the shortage. But 
																	<a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/8599">Sean O’Leary</a>, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Colorado’s medical school, says the shortage should never have occurred.
																</p>
																<p id="BLVrFN">O’Leary serves as the American Academy of Pediatrics liaison to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “We were consistently told that there would not be a supply problem — that there would be plenty,” he said. “And so that piece was extraordinarily frustrating for me.”</p>
																<p id="GVbTlZ">There were several other barriers O’Leary knew might impede the Beyfortus rollout, though. Inadequate supply should be a temporary speed bump in the drug’s distribution, but a different and more entrenched obstacle will likely create challenges for Beyfortus access for a while, he said: “The ridiculous way that we pay for vaccines in this country.”</p>
																<h3 id="DYGN71">How Beyfortus works </h3>
																<p id="cpsHzC">RSV is deadly to babies on a global scale. In the US alone, it causes 58,000 hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths 
																	<a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00498.asp#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20every%20year,ages%2065%20years%20and%20older.">each year</a>. So when scientists finally figured out how to produce a vaccine that would protect people from the virus’s worst outcomes a few years ago, it was considered a 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23424379/rsv-cold-virus-vaccines-monoclonal-antibodies-flu-covid-maternal-babies-infants-older-adults">massive breakthrough</a> in child health. 
																</p>
																<p id="kzqXCe">Babies as old as 19 months who were born prematurely or have other underlying conditions are at risk for bad RSV disease. However, the risk to babies is highest in their first six months of life, and about 
																	<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/226/Supplement_2/S246/6666008?login=false">40 percent</a> of American infants who died of RSV over the past few decades were otherwise healthy. 
																</p>
																<p id="Eby3lp">But there’s a problem with trying to vaccinate babies who are only a few months old: Their immune systems are too immature to do much in response to vaccines. In order to protect these babies, they either need to 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/hcp/pregnant-patients.html">get antibodies while they’re still in the womb</a> — by passively receiving them from their parent — or as an injection once they’re out. 
																</p>
																<p id="OFuJSQ">Beyfortus is the latter kind of product. It’s a 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23800167/rsv-shot-infants-fda-antibodies-vaccine-flu-health">monoclonal antibody</a> that does for a baby what a vaccine would do in an older child with a more robust immune system: effectively protect them from a severe RSV infection. 
																</p>
																<p id="9VpEmz">The CDC also recently recommended another product, a maternal vaccine called 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0922-RSV-maternal-vaccine.html">Abrysvo</a>, to immunize babies during pregnancy. It works by stimulating antibody production in the parent that gets transferred to baby through the placenta. To be effective, it has to be given to the pregnant parent between weeks 32 and 36 of pregnancy — which means it’s too late for babies born early this fall to be protected by this vaccine. 
																</p>
																<p id="wJZOIc">That makes Beyfortus the only option to protect them from severe RSV. </p>
																<h3 id="if5EGF">Stocking drugs like Beyfortus is financially risky for many pediatricians </h3>
																<p id="wr32oG">Demand for Beyfortus currently exceeds supply. But as the need for the drug becomes more predictable, and as other 
																	<a href="https://www.path.org/resources/rsv-vaccine-and-mab-snapshot/">monoclonal RSV antibodies in development</a> make it onto the market, we can expect supply to better meet that demand. 
																</p>
																<p id="kxLtTF">It’s more complicated to fix the fragmented US health care system that creates big barriers to Beyfortus access for some kids, O’Leary said. That system is structured such that many pediatricians have to take huge financial risks to keep Beyfortus in stock. For patients who get care at those practices, access will likely be a little touch-and-go until demand also stabilizes and pediatricians can better forecast how much to stock. </p>
																<p id="sBkeBH">Why is it so risky for some pediatricians to stock certain immunization products?</p>
																<p id="XfMN9X">It has to do with who’s paying for the products, and how much they cost. Pediatric vaccines are paid for and distributed in the US through two main mechanisms. About 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/parents/qa-flyer.html#:~:text=The%20Vaccines%20for%20Children%20(VFC,years%20old%20receive%20VFC%20vaccine.">half of American kids</a> get vaccines paid for by the federal government through a program called 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html">Vaccines for Children</a>, or VFC. The program’s goal is to ensure cost isn’t a barrier to vaccinating kids, so 
																	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/providers/eligibility.html">eligibility</a> is restricted to kids who are Medicaid-eligible, under- or uninsured, or American Indian or Alaska Native. 
																</p>
																<p id="cuMmba">The other half of American kids get vaccines paid for by private insurance companies, but only after the pediatrician administers it. What insurance companies pay for each vaccine isn’t always enough to cover its full cost, and the pediatrician often doesn’t know how much an insurance company will pay them for a vaccine until after the fact.</p>
																<p id="rcb7SG">This setup means ordering any vaccine is somewhat of a financial risk to pediatric practices. But because most vaccines are relatively cheap, and because their familiarity to most parents makes demand relatively predictable, the risk is relatively small.</p>
																<p id="K18OyS">The math is totally different for Beyfortus, though: One dose costs a doctor’s office 
																	<a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-prevention/nirsevimab-beyfortus-product--ordering-information/#:~:text=Nirsevimab%20purchase%20cost,200mg%20dose%20(Two%20100mg%20doses)">nearly $500</a> — and as a totally novel immunization, its popularity was hard to forecast. “For a medium-sized practice, they might have to spend $250,000 to cover their patient population,” O’Leary said. “And that is not money they have lying around.”
																</p>
																<p id="oDJrXf">“It’s not that pediatricians and family docs don’t want to do the right thing,” he added — but the financial risk of just keeping Beyfortus on the shelves is a barrier. </p>
																<p id="AgQMCL">A universal vaccination program that made vaccines available across the lifespan, free of charge, would be wonderful, O’Leary said, and it’s what other industrialized countries like 
																	<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/vaccines">Canada</a> and the 
																	<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2021/12/Coming_to_the_UK__migrant_vaccinations_leaflet.pdf">United Kingdom</a> do. “But that’s not where we are,” he said.

																<p>The Marvel star faces domestic assault charges, and now other allegations spanning years.</p>
																<p id="a7t8k1">New allegations of abuse and domestic violence continue to surface against Jonathan Majors. The Emmy-nominated 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21367860/lovecraft-country-hbo-review-no-spoilers">
																		<em>Lovecraft Country</em>
																	</a> and 
																	<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23611236/creed-3-review-michael-b-jordan-jonathan-majors">
																		<em>Creed III</em>
																	</a> star was arrested in New York in March 2023 on misdemeanor charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment in a reported domestic dispute with his 
																	<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/03/25/jonathan-majors-arrested-assault-woman-nyc-new-york/">girlfriend</a>. (The strangulation charge was later dropped.) Since then, accusations have flown back and forth between Majors and the woman involved in the incident. 
																</p>
																<p id="2SzvwT">
																	<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jonathan-majors-abuse-allegations-yale-1234781136/">As previously
																		<strong></strong>reported by Rolling Stone
																	</a>, Majors stands accused of a decade-long pattern of relationships in which he was allegedly controlling, manipulative, and in some cases physically abusive. Now a court filing in Majors’s case has revealed that prosecutors are seeking info about an additional police report connected to the case.
																</p>
																<p id="0J4B8B">According to 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-majors-criminal-case-new-details-police-incident-london-1235766520/">Variety</a>, 
																	<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/10/jonathan-majors-domestic-violence-trial-uk-police-report-1235581808/">Deadline</a>, and 
																	<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jonathan-majors-domestic-violence-case-london-police-1234860571/">Rolling Stone</a>, the filing — a response to Majors’s motion to dismiss the case against him — runs 115 pages and contains many new details about the night Majors allegedly assaulted his former girlfriend. The New York district attorney’s office also pushes back against claims made by Majors’s defense in the filing, disputing the defense’s portrayal of the incident and accusing Majors’s legal team of leaking and miscontextualizing information in the case. They even seem to accuse the defense of falsifying a witness statement they say never existed.
																	<strong></strong>
																</p>
																<p id="AWYNRq">It had previously been 
																	<a href="https://www.insider.com/marvels-jonathan-majors-files-nypd-complaint-against-assault-accuser-sources-2023-6">reported</a> that police found probable cause to arrest Majors’s ex-girlfriend after Majors filed a cross-complaint of assault against her. But no arrest materialized, and the new filing make it clear that the district attorney’s office never seriously considered charging her. 
																</p>
																<p id="HqPuLs">Perhaps more alarmingly, the filing also makes mention of a previous police report filed in London in 2022, obtained by prosecutors. Few details are currently known about the incident, but the district attorney implies that it could implicate Majors in a previous domestic assault of the same woman, which resulted in her receiving medical care. The district attorney has reportedly also obtained her medical records.</p>
																<p id="Z4o5Vt">The initial charges came as a deep shock to fans of Majors, whose public persona during his rapid rise through Hollywood has 
																	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgyA5ghJfOM">purveyed</a> a soft-spoken, sensitive masculinity.
																</p>
																<p id="tHPNlG">Yet they were just the beginning of allegations about Majors’s behavior. After his arrest, two directors 
																	<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/two-directors-speak-out-about-jonathan-majors-alleged-vicious-cruel-behavior-and-more-after-actors-assault-arrest">spoke publicly</a> about what one called Majors’s “emotionally violent/professionally abusive” history. In April, 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-majors-more-alleged-abuse-victims-cooperate-with-da-office-assault-1235588870/">Variety reported</a> that “multiple alleged abuse victims” of Majors had come forward in the wake of the incident and were working with the district attorney’s office. 
																</p>
																<p id="etY7w3">The Rolling Stone allegations span 10 years, beginning in 2013 with Majors’s entry into the Yale drama school, where he quickly became a notable presence.
																	<strong></strong>Multiple anonymous sources paint a picture of Majors as volatile, controlling, intense, physically intimidating, and sometimes aggressive, a characterization that has followed him onto Hollywood sets, with some production staff describing him as physically and verbally intimidating. At the center of the allegations are claims from multiple third parties that Majors was emotionally and physically abusive with one romantic partner, to the point of allegedly strangling her. Another woman allegedly described her relationship with him as “emotional torture.” Both women declined to be interviewed. 
																</p>
																<p id="hsC3J8">Through his lawyer, Majors denied all accusations, pointing out that the Rolling Stone report was effectively hearsay. Rolling Stone further claimed that half of the character witnesses Majors’s legal team provided to them “never gave Majors’ team permission to release such statements.” </p>
																<p id="d0jqi9">Majors has contested the allegations that led to the March arrest, but the new filing from prosecutors details specific aggressive actions Major took and specific injuries incurred by the woman.
																	<strong></strong>The first wave of news following Majors’s arrest
																	<strong></strong>prompted shock across social media and led to a complex array of public reactions. It’s also led to professional fallout: 
																	<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/jonathan-majors-dropped-hollywood-manager-domestic-violence-1235325576/">Deadline reported</a> on April 17
																	<strong></strong>that Majors’s manager, Entertainment 360, had dropped him from its client roster; a day later, Deadline 
																	<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/jonathan-majors-losing-work-otis-redding-movie-texas-rangers-ads-the-man-in-my-basement-1235329772/">followed up</a> with news that several upcoming film projects as well as a Major League Baseball ad campaign scheduled to be released later this week had all dropped Majors from his planned roles.
																</p>
																<p id="NBC5Tr">Despite these developments, the arrest might not be terminal for Majors’s career. Regarding his starring role as Marvel’s next big villain, Kang, Deadline observed that currently there are “zero conversations in the Marvel camp to drop Majors from the MCU.” Variety cautioned, however, that “Disney is monitoring the fast-moving situation.” As of October, with the date of Majors’s trial nearing, Marvel has made no moves to fire Majors.</p>
																<h3 id="wvMX7y">Majors’s star had been on the rise. The arrest may change that.</h3>
																<p id="cbR4jz">Majors had a truly storied run leading up to his March arrest. A lifelong army brat, Majors spent his childhood hopping across the country between various military bases with his family. He had a rough adolescence and 
																	<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jonathan-majors-last-black-man-san-francisco-how-acting-served-as-a-guiding-light-1253573/">credits theater</a> for pulling him out of his rut; he majored in theater at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and went on to get a master’s from Yale. While there, he quickly found his way into the industry and won critical acclaim for 2019’s 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/5/18638962/last-black-man-in-san-francisco-review">
																		<em>Last Black Man in San Francisco</em>
																	</a>. Since then, his career has been constantly on the ascent — until the morning of March 25, when, allegedly, Majors and his girlfriend broke into a fight in a car
																	<strong></strong>as they returned from a night out in Brooklyn.
																</p>
																<p id="LWYWqI">TMZ 
																	<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/03/25/jonathan-majors-arrested-assault-woman-nyc-new-york/">broke the story</a> on the
																	<strong></strong>afternoon after Majors’s arrest, reporting that Majors had been receiving texts from other women, which angered his girlfriend and led to a confrontation. 
																	<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/03/27/jonathan-majors-arrest-assault-charges-explained/11546985002/">Some reports state</a> that the woman called 911 over the alleged assault; however, one report 
																	<a href="https://abc7ny.com/jonathan-majors-nyc-arrest-creed-iii-actor/13019873/">citing “police sources” claimed</a> Majors called the police out of stated concern for his girlfriend. (Per media reports, the new district attorney filing seems to allege only one phone call from the scene, but it’s currently unclear who made the call.) Upon arriving at the scene, police observed “minor injuries” to the woman’s head and neck and arrested Majors. Majors was 
																	<a href="https://apnews.com/article/jonathan-majors-arrested-3ccf23bb407f5e6d2441ccc536b254f2">released</a> without bond on March 25
																	<strong></strong>on an order of protection (a restraining order) and was arraigned 
																	<a href="https://apnews.com/article/jonathan-majors-arrested-3ccf23bb407f5e6d2441ccc536b254f2">the next day</a>, but 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-major-alleged-assault-evidence-1235564860/">the strangulation charge</a> was not included. A 
																	<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jonathan-majors-trial-1234774532/">later version</a> of the woman’s statement removed the strangulation allegation and instead claimed that Majors shoved her into the side of a car. His trial on the charges has been delayed repeatedly. 
																</p>
																<p id="RFxLRP">A 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-major-alleged-assault-evidence-1235564860/">statement released</a> by Majors’s attorney, Priya Chaudhry, asserts that Majors is the victim, claiming not only that the woman has since recanted her accusations in two written statements, but that video footage and other witness testimony will support Majors. The statement further claimed that Majors’s girlfriend was in the middle of an “emotional crisis” at the time of the incident, after which she was hospitalized. (Chaudhry was recently in the spotlight for another celebrity criminal case; she represented 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/6/23542202/jen-shah-real-housewife-sentencing-78-months">convicted former 
																		<em>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’s </em>Jen Shah
																	</a> on charges of defrauding the elderly.)
																</p>
																<p id="BAczCO">However, in its most recent filing, the prosecution has reportedly disputed all of these claims. It insists that no video footage of the incident existed, and paints the defense as attempting to manufacture the appearance of a retraction on the part of the victim by leaking screenshots of text exchanges between Majors and her.
																	<strong></strong>
																</p>
																<p id="zsCGGd">Shortly after the news of Majors’s arrest broke, social media buzzed with anecdotal reports that Majors, who received a master’s in drama from Yale, had a long and well-known history of abusive behavior in both the Yale and New York theater scenes. Social media users recalled a 
																	<a href="https://twitter.com/A_B_Allen/status/1639781087881891841">since-deleted</a> tweet made in February by filmmaker and director’s assistant A.B. Allen. “There’s a particular actor, relatively new on the scene, who Twitter has violently fallen head over heels for,” Allen wrote, “who, in actuality, is a vicious, cruel, abusive human being, both professionally and in his personal life, and every new viral thirst tweet about him drives me insane.”
																</p>
																<p id="H2ZDtO">After the news about Majors broke, Allen appeared to 
																	<a href="https://thedirect.com/article/avengers-5-actor-arrest-accused">confirm</a> (again in a 
																	<a href="https://twitter.com/A_B_Allen/status/1639781087881891841">since-deleted</a> tweet) that the earlier tweet referred to Majors. Allen then 
																	<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/two-directors-speak-out-about-jonathan-majors-alleged-vicious-cruel-behavior-and-more-after-actors-assault-arrest">clarified</a> that they had known Majors to be “emotionally violent/professionally abusive” but not physically violent.
																</p>
																<p id="LAE1T6">Actor and stage director Tim Nicolai was even more pointed, 
																	<a href="https://thedirect.com/article/avengers-5-actor-arrest-accused">alleging</a> in a 
																	<a href="https://twitter.com/tim_nicolai/status/1639790915219779584">since-deleted</a> tweet that “folks at Yale and the broader NYC community have known about [Majors] for years.”
																</p>
																<p id="viD8mn">“He’s a sociopath and abuser and that is how virtually everyone speaks about him,” Nicolai stated. “It’s a shame it took this long for him to be reported.”</p>
																<p id="UmjggW">Neither Allen nor Nicolai provided specific allegations of things Majors had done. When asked by multiple social media users why neither of them came forward before this to warn the public about him, both Allen and Nicolai 
																	<a href="https://fandomwire.com/its-a-relief-he-may-never-get-to-again-jonathan-majors-accusers-explain-why-his-abusive-behavior-wasnt-exposed-earlier-as-marvel-star-faces-potential-hollywood-bl/">pointed toward</a> their unwillingness to name and involve the people they say Majors harmed. Both have since made their Twitter accounts private.
																</p>
																<h3 id="pb2ZwJ">The public’s reactions to the allegations have understandably been mixed</h3>
																<p id="cfc6m2">The timing of the allegations couldn’t be worse for Majors, who recently starred in 
																	<em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em> and is slated to be 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/2/16/23601025/ant-man-quantumania-credits-scene-kang-jonathan-majors">the next major Marvel villain</a>. Now, much as with 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/23013773/ezra-miller-arrest-restraining-order-what-happened-the-flash-hiatus">
																		<em>The Flash</em>’s Ezra Miller
																	</a>, his career could be in jeopardy due to his alleged violence, at the precise moment he’s poised to reach new heights of fame.
																</p>
																<p id="gAbJ1U">Still, the many questions and unknowns surrounding Majors’s arrest have led to mixed reactions from the public. Would it really be possible for a pattern of disturbing, “sociopathic” behavior to go unaddressed for years while Majors rose through the ranks of Hollywood? Is it possible that the police made false assumptions based on Majors’s race and the surface-level optics of a complex situation? Could a guy who told NPR less than a month ago that masculinity includes “kindness,” “vulnerability,” and “gentleness” really be violent? (We should note that in the same interview he also 
																	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgyA5ghJfOM">states</a>, “I wouldn’t wanna walk up on me in the street.”)
																</p>
																<p id="7Qhocs">On the other hand, far too often in situations of intimate partner violence, the justice system disempowers victims, forcing the abused into impossible positions that ultimately enable their abusers — even when the alleged abuser isn’t a rich, famous, powerful celebrity. As many people have 
																	<a href="https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/jonathan-majors-wastes-no-time-implementing-the-darvo-strategy.php">observed</a>, if Majors’s girlfriend really was assaulted, and if Majors indeed called the police himself and framed his girlfriend as the instigator, he’s employing a classic tactic of domestic abuse: DARVO, or “deny, attack, and reverse victim/offender.”
																</p>
																<p id="itwlQY">This is a tactic that has played a role in several recent high-profile cases, including 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/22684204/gabby-petito-missing-updates-internet-web-sleuthing">the murder of Gabby Petito</a>, in which her partner successfully framed her to police as the instigator of her own domestic abuse — even though a 911 caller reported that he had been seen physically assaulting her. It also 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23043519/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-fairfax-county-domestic-abuse-violence-me-too">played a prominent role</a> in debates surrounding the Amber Heard-Johnny Depp defamation lawsuit, with supporters of either side accusing the other of utilizing DARVO.
																</p>
																<aside id="ca9dC8">
																	<div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to prevent another death like Gabby Petito’s","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/22758030/gabby-petito-domestic-intimate-partner-violence-prevention"}]}'></div>
																</aside>
																<p id="Qk5io8">In this case, if that’s Majors’s MO, it’s already been effective: His lawyer is directly contradicting the witness account of the incident that led to his arrest, declaring that Majors himself is “provably the victim” of the incident, not the woman who had visible marks on her body. (Majors was 
																	<a href="https://people.com/movies/jonathan-majors-spotted-leaving-nyc-courthouse-after-his-arrest-in-freedom-hat/">spotted leaving</a> the courthouse after his arrest in March in a cap emblazoned with the word “Freedom.”) His supporters are lining up to argue that with the primary witness already recanting, there’s plenty of reasonable doubt. However, detractors have also noted that survivors will 
																	<a href="https://www.findlaw.com/family/domestic-violence/the-recanting-victim-and-domestic-violence.html">frequently recant</a> their statements in incidents of intimate partner violence — not because they aren’t true, but because they fear reprisals.
																</p>
																<p id="lT2t8T">Indeed, on March 30, in an apparent effort to tarnish the credibility of Majors’s accuser, his lawyer 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-majors-text-messages-assault-arrest-1235568826/">released text messages</a> she allegedly sent to him in which she appears to accept all the blame for the incident: “I told them it was my fault for trying to grab your phone. I only just got out of hospital.” However, her texts are pleading and contradictory, confirming she suffered injuries — something the district attorney’s most recent filing also reportedly confirms — and giving the impression she’s desperate to avoid further problems. They don’t exactly exonerate Majors. “They basically look like the text messages of a textbook abused woman,” an anonymous source 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-majors-more-alleged-abuse-victims-cooperate-with-da-office-assault-1235588870/">told Variety</a>.
																</p>
																<p id="nLCd4E">Also alarming is that the woman’s text messages further indicate that she had “collaps[ed] and pass[ed] out” during the incident, which implies that she was not only strangled but strangled to the point of unconsciousness. Intimate partner strangulation is 
																	<a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/manual-strangulation-is-the-biggest-sign-domestic-abuse-will-turn-deadly-experts-say/531-0a9a92c8-a0da-418a-b81e-a3d80ddacf38">an extremely high risk factor</a> for eventual homicide. That is: People who strangle or choke their partners are far more likely to escalate to killing them later on. Strangulation charges against Majors were dropped, but the fact that the woman suffered injuries on her neck (and was granted a restraining order) carries disturbing implications. 
																</p>
																<p id="p5ijuO">Many people have 
																	<a href="https://twitter.com/briartearose/status/1639821403594674177">compared</a> Majors’s girlfriend to Amber Heard — implying, depending on their view, either that she’s lying or that she’s being unfairly publicly trashed for reporting her assault. In either case, the comparison indicates a level of strong support for Majors.
																</p>
																<p id="oQ9Yrq">Yet more abuse allegations against Majors may be forthcoming. Per Variety, “
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-majors-more-alleged-abuse-victims-cooperate-with-da-office-assault-1235588870/">multiple</a>” women have reportedly contacted prosecutors about Majors. Their testimony would bolster the charges against Majors, and this new movement in the case would certainly explain the sudden rush, in mid-April, to drop Majors from multiple projects after several weeks of what seemed to be an industry holding pattern.
																</p>
																<p id="1jJRRo">In response to the arrest, the US Army 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/jonathan-majors-united-states-army-commercials-dropped-1235564855/">pulled</a> its recently launched ad campaign featuring Majors but clarified that the campaign was only being halted temporarily. “While Mr. Majors is innocent until proven guilty, prudence dictates that we pull our ads until the investigation into these allegations is complete,” a spokesperson 
																	<a href="https://apnews.com/article/jonathan-majors-arrested-3ccf23bb407f5e6d2441ccc536b254f2">stated</a>.
																</p>
																<p id="QjTSxE">Majors’s PR firm and eventually his talent management both followed suit, according to 
																	<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/jonathan-majors-dropped-hollywood-manager-domestic-violence-1235325576/">an April 17 report</a> by Deadline. A day later, 
																	<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/jonathan-majors-losing-work-otis-redding-movie-texas-rangers-ads-the-man-in-my-basement-1235329772/">Deadline claimed</a> Majors had subsequently been dropped from several upcoming film projects, including the thriller 
																	<em>The Man in My Basement</em>, which Majors was to have 
																	<a href="https://deadline.com/2022/08/willem-dafoe-nadia-latifs-the-man-in-my-basement-1235085147/">produced and starred in</a> alongside Willem Dafoe. An Otis Redding biopic, 
																	<em>Otis and Zelma, </em>was also considering casting Majors as the lead but has moved on from him since the scandal broke. Per Deadline, this year’s Met Gala also disinvited him.
																</p>
																<p id="dEuLCG">
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/jonathan-majors-more-alleged-abuse-victims-cooperate-with-da-office-assault-1235588870/">Per Variety</a>, Majors also resigned from his role with the Sidney Poitier Initiative, a career development program for Black creatives that 
																	<a href="https://www.ebony.com/exploring-jonathan-majors-sidney-poitier-initiative/#:~:text=The%20Sidney%20Poitier%20Initiative%20seeks,scholarship%20and%20project%2Dbased%20funding.">Majors created</a> in 2022 
																	<a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/jonathan-majors-gotham-sidney-poitier-initiative-1235448306/">as part of</a> the Gotham Film and Media Institute. Majors also served on the board of the Gotham Institute; he has resigned from that role as well. 
																</p>
																<p id="PvyUAF">Majors’s supporters have been quick to 
																	<a href="https://twitter.com/TalbertSwan/status/1640134638969520128">call out</a> double standards in how famous white men are treated when they’re accused of domestic violence versus famous Black men. Meanwhile, Marvel has given no public indication about whether it plans to drop Majors from the franchise. If the primary witness has indeed recanted, moving forward with charges will be difficult for prosecutors;
																	<strong></strong>however, it increasingly appears that reports that the victim recanted have been exaggerated by the defense.
																</p>
																<p id="j7NZf7">If charges against Majors are ultimately dropped, could he escape this incident unscathed? Marvel has cast at least one public figure accused of domestic assault before; Josh Brolin’s 2004 
																	<a href="https://people.com/movies/josh-brolin-addresses-2004-diane-lane-domestic-abuse-arrest-no-explaining/">arrest for allegedly </a>
																	<a href="https://people.com/celebrity/josh-brolin-arrested-for-spousal-battery/">assaulting</a> his wife of four months at the time, Diane Lane, barely made a dent in his long career, and he went on to play the big bad Thanos. Lane declined to press charges, and a joint spokesperson for the couple reportedly 
																	<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/josh-brolin-stands-nyc-on-screen-woody-allen-meet-tall-dark-stranger-article-1.439789">called</a> the incident a “misunderstanding.” They divorced in 2013, and while Brolin occasionally still gets asked about the incident, it doesn’t seem to have impacted him in the long term.
																</p>
																<p id="6nu8uc">But Majors, by virtue of being a buff, physically powerful Black man, may also have different standards applied to his career rehabilitation, if one is needed. It wouldn’t be the first time recently that a Black celebrity’s punishment for public misbehavior might 
																	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/15/jussie-smollett-jail-sentence-unfair/">spark debate</a> for 
																	<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23628949/chris-rock-will-smith-oscars-slap-netflix-selective-outrage-comedy-special">being too severe</a>. Amid all of that, Black men often 
																	<a href="https://hechingerreport.org/opinion-black-men-too-often-resist-therapy-and-shy-away-from-mental-health-careers/">face complicated obstacles</a> to mental health care and wellness. That doesn’t change if someone becomes a Hollywood celebrity; in fact, those stressors might even intensify.
																</p>
																<p id="WMQIof">Absolutely none of that excuses Majors’s alleged assault. But these factors further complicate knowing how to respond to domestic assault allegations when there are contradictory accounts and arguably everyone involved has a level of vulnerability. For now, Majors appears to be denying there is any truth to the allegations. With the accusing witness remaining silent, we might have a long wait for the full truth to emerge.</p>

																<p>To find out who did, look all the way back to the start of the story.</p>
																<p id="IfvOhQ">Twitter is a disaster. </p>
																<p id="LawfyI">But you know that already.</p>
																<p id="Ke0fXx">
																	<em>Why</em> is Twitter a disaster? 
																</p>
																<p id="Ez0VOx">You probably think you know that, too: The usual suspect is Elon Musk, who has spent the year he’s owned Twitter doing his best to drive away users, advertisers, and any remaining sense of fun or utility the service used to have. (He’s also inexplicably renamed it “X,” which I’ll mention here solely to appease Vox’s excellent copy editors.)</p>
																<p id="C8lsex">But I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about Twitter’s history recently — because I’m the host of The Twitter Fantasy, Vox Media’s newest installment of its 
																	<a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/land-of-the-giants">
																		<em>Land of the Giants</em>
																	</a> podcast series, which launches today. And I don’t think Elon is the right answer for this whodunit.
																</p>
																<div id="z1F4Sd">
																	<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3998816895&amp;start=0" width="100%"></iframe>
																</div>
																<p id="UieNGL">Elon has definitely, demonstrably made Twitter 
																	<em>worse</em>. But I’d argue that Twitter’s present is a direct consequence of its shambolic origin story, where its co-founders and funders couldn’t decide what it ought to be. And that when they finally did decide, they set themselves up for eventual disappointment.
																</p>
																<p id="czyx4X">“Some people would look at it and say, ‘Oh God, this is like short-form email’ … ‘This is the future of communications’ … ‘This is the public square,’” says Betaworks CEO John Borthwick, who sold multiple startups to Twitter in its early years and had a ringside seat for its early growing pains. “Twitter didn’t actually state what they were. And so they could be many things to many different people.”</p>
																<p id="L2LMkD">What Twitter and its investors finally did decide is that the company would be the next Facebook: a venture-backed social network fueled by its users’ content and supported by advertising. And that didn’t seem crazy in the late 2000s: The brief history of social networks up until that time was that each one was bigger and more valuable than the last, and Twitter was following Facebook, which was already supposedly worth billions.</p>
																<p id="vrHj14">The problem is that by the time Twitter went public in 2013, it was already clear that it 
																	<em>wasn’t </em>going to be Facebook. It wasn’t going to have anything like Facebook’s ginormous user base, and it didn’t have Facebook’s money-printing advertising machine. So if you wanted to invest in a fast-growing, money-making internet company, you invested in Facebook, not Twitter. Which meant Twitter’s stock languished while Facebook’s skyrocketed, and by the time Musk showed up and was willing to overpay for Twitter in 2022, no one had a better idea what to do with the company.
																</p>
																<p id="I7M16x">And that’s part of the story we tell in this episode, which you can listen to below. </p>
																<p id="mbz9Jh">It’s also not the whole story. And, I should point out, it’s not a story everyone agrees with. Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, for instance, thinks the key moment in Twitter’s history was its failed attempt to buy Instagram, months before Facebook actually did buy the startup for $1 billion.</p>
																<p id="cVreUO">If Twitter had pulled off the deal, Costolo told me, “we would’ve won… [and] that probably would’ve changed the course of the internet in some important way.”</p>
																<p id="rKRZhx">Even still, Twitter managed — often in spite of itself — to be a fundamentally important company, and it’s not going away anytime soon. So this has been a tremendously entertaining podcast series to put together. I hope you like it, and even if you don’t I’d love to hear your feedback. Please listen above or on 
																	<a href="https://link.chtbl.com/DGvnXMiz">your favorite app</a>, and 
																	<a href="mailto:kafkaonmedia@recode.net">drop me a line here</a> with your questions and commentary.

																<p id="2ZvZVl">In the year 2023, you hear less about how nature is healing and more about how nature is fighting back. </p>
																<p id="1W9bfP">First, it was the orcas. A small pod of them became infamous last spring for ramming boats off the coast of Spain. </p>
																<p id="qk797n">Now, it’s the javelinas, furry pig-like mammals that live in the Southwest.</p>
																<p id="Bmdvj4">On Sunday, the assistant superintendent of a private golf club in Sedona, Arizona, posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showing damage on the course caused by javelinas. Basically, a lot of pristine green grass had been churned up.</p>

																</div>
																<p id="pf6tL0">“What should be one of the most beautiful golf courses in the country is being destroyed by herds of javelina,” Emily Casey, the golf club’s superintendent, wrote on X. </p>
																<p id="lIiSlA">The post went viral, garnering more than 24 million views in a few days. </p>
																<p id="UpwKB2">Many X users cheered on “team javelina” for waging war against an elite golf course. It’s an easy target. Golf courses often cater to the wealthy — this particular club costs thousands of dollars to join — and they have a sizable environmental footprint, replacing vast stretches of natural habitat and sucking up 
																	<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2022/3/22/22988989/an-illogical-oasis-golf-course-water-usage-st-george-golf">loads of water</a>.
																</p>
																<p id="RqYyUd">Several major news outlets, meanwhile, had a different reaction. They were quick to demonize the creatures, describing them as brutish invaders set on destroying a carefully manicured landscape. “Hungry javelinas plague prestigious Arizona golf course,” 
																	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/24/arizona-javelina-pig-destroy-golf-course#:~:text=Greenkeepers%20at%20the%20picturesque%20Seven,large%20areas%20of%20the%20course.">one headline</a> read. It’s an unsurprising framing for stories involving animals inconveniencing humans and their things. 
																</p>
																<p id="6L6OMR">Neither of these reactions is particularly helpful, and the latter, some experts argue, has the story backward. Though javelinas have been spreading north in recent decades, they’re a native species to the Southwest. Golf courses are destroying their habitat, not the other way around. These animals are using what resources they can find — in this case, juicy fairways and water-filled roots under a golf green. We can’t fault them for that. </p>
																<h3 id="y8DQgj">Why javelinas are digging up a golf course </h3>
																<p id="ZrYgxT">With stubby legs, hoofed feet, and a hog-like snout, javelinas, also known as collared peccaries, range from tropical South America, where they originally evolved, to the southwestern US. They only arrived in the Arizona desert within the last century or two, and they’ve been moving north in recent decades. Nonetheless, they’re considered native to the region. Arizona is their home.</p>
																<p id="HPqtw9">These animals are abundant in the state, largely because they’ve learned to live alongside human communities, taking advantage of any resources they can find, said Sonny Bleicher, an ecologist at Xavier University of Louisiana who has researched javelinas in Arizona. They will rummage through trash and drink water from fountains and cattle ranches. They’ll also dig up roots and tubers wherever they can find them. </p>
																<p id="E16hHq">Roots can provide both food and water, said 
																	<a href="https://conservation.arizona.edu/person/alexandra-allie-burnett">Alexandra Burnett</a>, a doctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, who studies javelinas and other urban animals. So it’s not surprising, she said, that javelinas would try to root them out in a golf club in Sedona (no matter how exclusive it may be). 
																</p>
																<p id="zSQ4CI">“The expectation that [javelinas] aren’t going to use the food resources on a golf course simply because it was engineered for and by humans is pretty preposterous to me,” Burnett told Vox. “I think humans have built up this idea of how they think the world works. What they’re really seeing — or what they’re really projecting on all animals — is how the human world works.”</p>
																<p id="cGpmVG">The landscapes where javelinas and other wildlife find food are also shrinking. For decades, humans have been replacing wild habitats like grasslands, deserts, and woodlands in Arizona — one of the nation’s 
																	<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/07/population-change-pandemic">fastest-growing states</a> — with housing developments, malls, and, of course, hundreds of golf courses. “[Javelinas] really don’t have much choice but to use artificial resources,” Burnett said, referring to human landscapes like golf courses. “That’s how they’ll survive.”

																	</figure>
																	<p id="EiAwG1">The golf course vs. javelina discourse is entertaining and, for the most part, lighthearted. Yet it points to something more troubling and existential: a growing disconnect between humans and nature. </p>
																	<p id="Q2QsO3">“It’s sad because we have coexisted with wildlife for our entire evolutionary history,” Burnett said. “Up until the past 200 or 300 years, this wasn’t seen as an ‘us versus them.’ It was just seen as living.” </p>
																	<p id="TQvrmu">To live on this planet is to compete with other living things for resources, she said, be they javelinas, coyotes, or wolves. If we want them to live here too — and we should really want that, as they are fundamental pieces of a complex ecosystem on which literally all life depends — we just have to learn to make our coexistence tolerable. </p>
																	<p id="nfHqcm">That doesn’t mean people should invite javelinas into their homes, Burnett said. These animals can be aggressive if they feel threatened, especially if they’re with their babies (and there are simple ways to avoid them). But if we’re looking to blame something for “plaguing” the environment, humans are a much more logical target. At the very least, if we continue mucking up their landscapes, we shouldn’t blame them for mucking up ours.</p>

																	<p>The battle over how large language models can use published works is just beginning. Copyright law isn’t ready.</p>
																	<p id="OoA3Ui">Four years ago, I published my first book: 
																		<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/end-times-a-brief-guide-to-the-end-of-the-world-bryan-walsh/113364">
																			<em>End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World</em>
																		</a>. 
																	</p>
																	<p id="JuujBE">It did ... okay? I earned a Q&amp;A with the site you’re reading now — 
																		<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/29/20830793/human-extinction-end-of-the-world-end-times-bryan-walsh">thanks, Dylan!</a> — and the book eventually helped get me the job of running Future Perfect. I had one day where I went from radio hit to radio hit, trying to explain in five-minute segments to morning DJs from Philadelphia to Phoenix why we should all be more worried about the threat of human extinction and what we could do to prevent it.
																	</p>
																	<p id="exam3S">But a bestseller it was not. Let’s put it this way — about every six months, I receive a letter from my publisher containing a “non-paying royalty statement,” which is sort of like getting a Christmas card from your parents, only instead of money, it just contains a note telling you how much they’ve spent raising you.</p>
																	<p id="DoBikP">So I’ll admit that I was a bit chuffed when I received an email a couple of months ago from people at 
																		<a href="https://aisafety.info/">aisafety.info</a>, who are aiming to create a centralized hub for explaining questions about 
																		<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23447596/artificial-intelligence-agi-openai-gpt3-existential-risk-human-extinction">AI safety and AI alignment</a> — how to make AI accountable to human goals — to a general audience. To that end, they were building a large language model — with the delightful name “
																		<a href="https://chat.stampy.ai/">Stampy</a>” — that could act as a chatbot, answering questions people might have about the subject. (The website was 
																		<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mHNoaNvpEuzzBEEfg/stampy-s-ai-safety-info-soft-launch">just soft launched</a>, while Stampy is still in the prototype stage.) And they were asking permission to use my book 
																		<em>End Times</em>, which contains a long chapter on existential risks from AI, as part of the data Stampy would be trained on.
																	</p>
																	<p id="cTboir">My first thought, like any author’s: Someone has actually read (or at least is aware of the existence of) my book! But then I had a second thought: As a writer, what does it mean to allow a chatbot to be trained on your own work? (And for free, no less.) Was I contributing to a project that could help people better understand a complex and important subject like AI safety? Or was I just speeding along the process of my own obsolescence?</p>
																	<h3 id="Erucyq">Training days</h3>
																	<p id="pz5xB7">These are live questions right now, with large language models like ChatGPT becoming more widespread and more capable. As my colleague Sara Morrison 
																		<a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/27/23808499/ai-openai-google-meta-data-privacy-nope">reported this summer</a>, a number of class action lawsuits have 
																		<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/18/1194562272/openai-is-facing-lawsuits-over-copyrighted-materials-it-uses-to-train-chatgpt">already been filed</a> against big tech firms like Google and OpenAI on behalf of writers and artists who claim that their work, including entire books, had been used to train chatbots without their permission and without remuneration. In August, a group of prominent novelists — including 
																		<em>Game of Thrones </em>author George R.R. Martin, who really has 
																		<a href="https://ew.com/tv/george-r-r-martin-says-hbo-deal-is-suspended-winds-of-winter-update/">some other deadlines he should attend to</a> — 
																		<a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-lawsuit-authors-grisham-george-rr-martin-37f9073ab67ab25b7e6b2975b2a63bfe">filed suit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI</a> for “systematic theft on a massive scale.” 
																	</p>
																	<p id="4G9GjN">Such concerns aren’t entirely new — tech companies have long come under fire for 
																		<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232469/shoshana-zuboff-age-surveillance-capitalism-book-google-facebook-privacy-data-kara-swisher">harnessing people’s data</a> to improve and perfect their products, often in ways that are far from transparent for the average user. But AI feels different, as attorney Ryan Clarkson, whose law firm is behind some of the class action lawsuits, told Sara. “Up until this point, tech companies have not done what they’re doing now with generative AI, which is to take everyone’s information and feed it into a product that can then contribute to people’s professional obsolescence and totally decimate their privacy in ways previously unimaginable.”
																	</p>
																	<p id="GnqjRb">I should note here that what aisafety.info is doing is fundamentally different from the work of companies like Meta or Microsoft. For one thing, they asked me, the author, for permission before using my work. Which was very polite! </p>
																	<p id="l9u08C">Beyond that, aisafety.info is a nonprofit research group, meaning that no one will be making money off the training data provided by my work. (A fact which, I suspect, will not surprise my publisher.) Stampy the chatbot will be an educational tool, and as someone who runs a section at Vox that cares deeply about the risk of powerful AI, I’m largely glad that my work can play some small role in making that bot smarter.</p>
																	<p id="fA4OHz">And we desperately need more reliable sources of information about AI risk. “I think the general understanding of AI alignment and safety is very poor,” Robert Miles of aisafety.info told me. “I would say that people care a lot more than they used to, but they don’t know a lot more.”</p>
																	<p id="f2ovGH">Chatbots, trained on the right source materials, can be 
																		<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/09/26/briefing-artificial-intelligence-education/">excellent educational tools</a>. An AI tutor can scale itself to the educational level of its student and can be kept up to date with the latest information about the subject. Plus, there’s the pleasant irony of using some of the latest breakthroughs in language models to create an educational tool designed to help people understand the potential danger of the very technology they’re using.
																	</p>
																	<h3 id="cVV78S">What’s “fair use” for AI?</h3>
																	<p id="kMiDST">I think that training a chatbot for nonprofit, educational purposes, with the express permission of the authors of the works on which it’s trained, seems okay. But do novelists like George R.R. Martin or John Grisham have a case against for-profit companies that take their work without that express permission?</p>
																	<p id="WxoObc">The law, unfortunately, is far from clear on this question. As Harvard Law professor and First Amendment expert Rebecca Tushnet 
																		<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/09/key-issues-in-writers-case-against-openai-explained/">explained in an interview</a> published in the Harvard Gazette, digital companies have generally been able to employ concepts of fair use to defend harvesting existing intellectual property. “The internet as we know it today, with Google and image search and Google Books, wouldn’t exist if it weren’t fair use to use these words for an output that was not copying” the original, she said. 
																	</p>
																	<p id="RcNUrN">One way to consider this is to think about how humans, like myself, write books. When I was researching and writing 
																		<em>End Times</em>, I was drawing upon and synthesizing the existing work of hundreds of different authors. Sometimes I would quote them directly, though there are specific rules about how much of an individual work another author can directly quote from under fair use. (The 
																		<a href="https://stevelaube.com/how-much-can-i-quote-from-another-source-without-permission/#:~:text=300%20or%20more%20words%20from,brief%20work%20(see%20above).">rough rule</a> is 300 words when quoting from a published book, or around 200 words for a briefer article or paper.) 
																	</p>
																	<p id="5tfePP">More often, though, what I read and processed in my research rattled around in my brain, combined with other reporting and reasoning, and came out as my own work — my work informed by my own sources. Or, in other words, informed by my own personal training dataset. </p>
																	<p id="wnoD4D">The difference, when it comes to AI, is one of scale. ChatGPT can “read” more published words in a few seconds than I could in several lifetimes and, unlike me, that data isn’t immediately replaced in my human-limited short-term memory by whatever I’m thinking of next. (
																		<a href="https://www.crossingbroad.com/2023/10/no-pressure-or-anything-but-if-the-phillies-lose-game-7-it-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-disappointments-in-philadelphia-sports-history.html">Playoff baseball,</a> if I’m being honest.) Legal scholars can draw on hundreds of years of copyright law to determine what to do in human cases, but laws that can accurately and fairly govern, or even understand, what AI can do with the same material have yet to be written.
																	</p>
																	<p id="NBl066">As Tushnet goes on to argue, we should be focusing less on legal questions that may not be answerable under current law, and more on shaping what we want and don’t want from language models. Chatbots trained to spread the gospel of AI safety, yes. AI-written versions of the

																			<em>Games of Thrones </em>series
